# Opswat_assessment
Opswat coding assessment in python 

Download the opswat directory and run the file "opswat_run.py"

To keep the working evironment clean and controlled, I have provided two sample text files.
These two files are the only valid files that can be run.
The first file "sample_txt.txt" has been run many times through metadefender cloud platform. 
The second file "sample_txt_unknown.txt" is a text file with a personal message, that has not been 
scanned through the metadefender cloud platform.

Upon running the python script, it will prompt you for the file name and extension. 
Enter one of the two valid files. 
The program will return the scan results if previoiusly cached, or upload the file, then print out results of the scan. 
The program will automatically end after the results are printed. Please run both files in order to see the effects, 
of a cached file and an unscanned file. 

Thank you
